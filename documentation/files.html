                            This programm can be used to convert images to PotatOSes low-level-picture format.
                            *.llp files can be viewed with the viewer.bin programm.

                        <h3>MkLocale</h3>

                            This programm reads the stringlist file and then builds the strings.sys which contains all the strings
                            and also created language.asm, which defines pointers to all the strings.
